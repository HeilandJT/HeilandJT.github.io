         <p>Hello, my name is Julius Heiland. I am in my fourth semester at Millersville University. I started off as a History major and switched to Technology Education last semester. I grew up enjoying wood and metal shop and was highly influenced by my teachers to switch. In high school I played soccer and basketball, but have decided to focus on school here at Millersville. I still play both sports in men's leagues to keep myself active since that is important to me. I also work part time at Lowes in the seasonal department. Doing all that and going to the gym allows me to take a break from school work and work at Lowes. <br><br>I was never certain what I wanted to do after high school. Right out of high school, I thought about going to Thaddeus Stevens where I was going to pursue some sort of electrician degree. But instead I decided to come to Millersville and I took a half gap year to work because I was uncertain on what I wanted to do in the future. Now four semesters in, I am glad I decided to take the half gap year and switch to Tech Ed. I plan on going back to Grad School after a few years of teaching to further my education. </p></td>
